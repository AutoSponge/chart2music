## Contributing

To work with the project, clone the repo, and run `npm install`. 

To run in watch mode, run `npm run start`. Then, in your browser, open: `localhost:8080/examples/chartjs.html`.

You can run tests with `npm run test`. Note, there's a pre-commit hook that verifies all tests pass before allowing commits.
